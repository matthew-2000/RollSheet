# 🧙‍♂️ RollSheet

Welcome, brave adventurer, to **RollSheet** — your personal spellbook for tracking characters across many perilous quests and tabletop campaigns!

## 🐉 What is This?

RollSheet is a macOS app (crafted in the arcane arts of Swift and SwiftUI) designed to help you manage your Dungeons & Dragons characters. Whether you're a seasoned dungeon delver or a newbie bard with a lute and a dream, this app makes tracking your stats, spells, gear, and personal legends as easy as casting *Mage Hand*.

This is a **personal project**, born out of my love for RPGs, organization, and staying up way too late designing characters I’ll never play. It may one day evolve into something even more magical. Or explode. That's part of the fun.

## ✨ Features

- Create detailed character sheets — name, race, class, level, stats, and more
- Track your inventory, spells, and battle conditions
- Add personal notes to remember epic tavern brawls and mysterious artifacts
- All data saved locally (for now, until the cloud druids bless us)
- Built for macOS Sonoma and ready for possible iPad adventures

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift 🧑‍💻
- **UI**: SwiftUI (as elegant as an elven blade)
- **Data Storage**: SwiftData (because CoreData is too... necromantic)
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Magic View-ViewModel?)

## 🛠 Modules

- Character List & Detail Views
- Inventory and Spellbook Managers
- Notes & Journal
- Status Condition Tracker

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

This app is still deep in the Dungeon of Development™. There are traps. There are dragons. Features might change, break, or get polymorphed.

Use at your own risk. And bring a cleric. ☠️

## 📦 Future Quests

- iCloud sync for cross-device journeying
- JSON export/import for sharing your mighty heroes
